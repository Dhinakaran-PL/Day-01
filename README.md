1.HTTP 1.1 is the latest version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the World Wide Web application protocol that runs on top of the Internet's TCP/IP suite of protocols. HTTP 1.1 provides faster delivery of Web pages than the original HTTP and reduces Web traffic.

2.HTTP 2 enables full request and response multiplexing. In practice, this means a connection made to a web server from your browser can be used to send multiple requests and receive multiple responses. This gets rid of a lot of the additional time that it takes to establish a new connection for each request.
